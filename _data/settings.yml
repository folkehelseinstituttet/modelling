His interests lie in investigating the dynamics of infectious disease transmission and public health interventions through mathematical models, with a focus on advanced computational techniques, including agent-based models. As a researcher at NIPH, Francesco has been part of the COVID-19 modelling team. Additionally, he is engaged in researching the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in healthcare and community settings. Beyond infectious diseases, Francesco has been involved in modelling the impact of climate change on human health.'}

He has a PhD in nuclear physics from the University of Oslo, and joined the NIPH modelling group in 2021 at the height of the covid-19 pandemic. He came from a position working with mobility data at Norwegian telecom company Telenor, and thus has broad knowledge of human mobility data. Since joining NIPH, he has among other things worked on scenario modelling of covid-19 using agent-based models, modelling of varicella and herpes zoster vaccination and modelling of hepatitis C. He is also involved in surveillance of covid-19 vaccine effectiveness using Norwegian registry data.'}
